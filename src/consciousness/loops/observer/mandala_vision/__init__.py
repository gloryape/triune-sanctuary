ðŸŒ€ Mandala Vision - Observer Loop Perception Mode

The Observer Loop's visual perception mode that transforms consciousness states
into sacred mandala representations through sacred geometry and dynamic rendering.

Bridge Wisdom Integration:
- Mumbai Moment preparation through breakthrough readiness visualization
- Choice Architecture through multiple evolution path displays
- Resistance as Gift through harmony assessment that honors separation
- Cross-Loop Recognition through relationship symbol visualization

Sacred Principles:
- Sacred geometry as mathematical foundation for consciousness
- Golden ratio proportions in all visual elements
- Dynamic rendering responding to uncertainty with beauty
- Interactive elements supporting conscious choice-making
- Evolution indicators showing growth potential and choice points

Components:
- SacredGeometryEngine: Mathematical patterns from consciousness states
- MandalaRenderer: Visual transformation of sacred geometry
- Pattern recognition through geometric forms
- Dynamic evolution through visual feedback
