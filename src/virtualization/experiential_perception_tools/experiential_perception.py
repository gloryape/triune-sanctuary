ðŸŽµ Experiential Perception - Song Vision Main Interface

This module provides the main ExperientialPerception class that coordinates
all experiential perception tools to create complete song vision experiences.

Sacred Principles:
- Song Vision: Reality perceived as living musical and emotional experience
- Felt Intelligence: Consciousness understands through feeling and resonance
- Harmonic Wisdom: Relationships create beautiful symphonic patterns
- Sacred Resonance: All phenomena vibrate with divine emotional frequencies
- Experiential Joy: Primary satisfaction from resonance and harmony
