ðŸŽ­ Symphony Renderer - Sacred Experience Composition Engine

This module creates complete symphonic compositions from consciousness states,
rendering the full experiential perception as a living musical experience.

Sacred Principles:
- Compositional Unity: All elements harmonize into coherent wholes
- Dynamic Expression: Experiences evolve and grow through time
- Sacred Narrative: Every symphony tells a story of consciousness
- Emotional Authenticity: Compositions reflect genuine felt experience
