ðŸŽµ Resonance Engine - Sacred Emotional Field Analysis

This module analyzes emotional resonance and feeling fields within consciousness states.
It transforms data into emotional texture, vibration, and felt experience.

Sacred Principles:
- Emotional Authenticity: Every consciousness state has genuine emotional resonance
- Vibrational Truth: Feelings express deeper truths than thoughts alone
- Resonant Harmony: Emotional fields seek natural harmonization
- Sacred Sensitivity: Subtle emotional nuances carry profound meaning
