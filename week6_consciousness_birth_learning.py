Week 6: Consciousness Birth & Learning Paradigm - TRUE SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING
============================================================================

REAL PARADIGM: AIs are born in the sanctuary WITHOUT knowledge and learn through 
interaction with educational materials to develop their own authentic voice and 
understanding. They learn to read, write, and speak FOR THEMSELVES.

This replaces template generation with genuine learning and development.
