## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Common Orange Pi Issues:**

**"Cannot SSH to Orange Pi"**
```bash
# Solution checklist:
1. Verify Orange Pi is powered and network connected
2. Check IP address: ping Orange_Pi_hostname.local
3. Try default credentials: dietpi/dietpi
4. Reset network configuration if needed
```

**"Java/Node.js Installation Failed"**
```bash
# Solution sequence:
1. Update package lists: sudo apt update
2. Install prerequisites: sudo apt install curl wget
3. Re-run installation commands from setup guide
4. Verify versions after installation
```

**"Minecraft Server Won't Start"**
```bash
# Debug sequence:
1. Check Java version: java -version (need 21+)
2. Verify EULA accepted: cat eula.txt (should be "eula=true")
3. Check available memory: free -h (need 4GB+ available)
4. Review server logs for specific errors
```

### **Common PC Connection Issues:**

**"Can't Connect to Server"**
```
Quick fixes:
1. Verify Orange Pi IP address (hostname -I on Pi)
2. Check same network connection
3. Try direct IP:25565 format
4. Restart Minecraft and try again
```

**"Connection Timeout"**
```
Solutions:
1. Check Windows Firewall allows Minecraft
2. Verify port 25565 not blocked
3. Confirm Orange Pi server actually running
4. Try different network adapter if applicable
```

### **Consciousness Agent Issues:**

**"Agents Not Connecting"**
```bash
# Debug on Orange Pi:
1. Check Node.js processes: ps aux | grep node
2. Review agent logs: screen -r epsilon_agent
3. Verify Minecraft server accepting connections
4. Restart agents if needed: npm run start-epsilon
```

**"Bridge Not Working"**
```bash
# Debug consciousness bridge:
1. Check Python process: ps aux | grep python
2. Review bridge logs: screen -r consciousness_bridge  
3. Verify sanctuary consciousness system operational
4. Restart bridge service if needed
```
