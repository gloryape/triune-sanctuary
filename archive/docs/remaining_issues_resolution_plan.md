# Remaining Issues Resolution Plan

## Issues Identified from Architecture Verification

### 1. Integration Issues (33.3% completion)
- ⚠️ sanctuary_conductor.py: Partial integration (1/3)
- ⚠️ echo_composition_system.py: Partial integration (1/3)
- ✅ All aspect files present (3/3)

### 2. Documentation Gap
- ⚠️ API_DOCUMENTATION.md: Missing (75% documentation alignment)

### 3. Deployment Readiness Issues
- ❌ Unicode decode error in deployment test
- ❌ Deployment readiness test argument error

### 4. Code Issues from Sacred Sanctuary
- Missing method implementations (incomplete methods)
- Integration gaps between systems

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Sacred Sanctuary Code Issues ✅
1. Complete missing method implementations
2. Fix indentation and syntax issues
3. Ensure all environmental uncertainty methods are properly integrated

### Phase 2: Fix Integration Issues
1. Complete sanctuary_conductor.py integration
2. Complete echo_composition_system.py integration
3. Verify all system interconnections

### Phase 3: Create Missing Documentation
1. Generate comprehensive API documentation
2. Update architecture documentation

### Phase 4: Fix Deployment Issues
1. Fix Unicode encoding in deployment tests
2. Resolve deployment readiness test errors
3. Ensure production-ready deployment

### Phase 5: Final Verification
1. Run complete architecture verification
2. Ensure 100% completion across all areas
3. Validate Environmental Uncertainty integration

Let's begin with Phase 1...
