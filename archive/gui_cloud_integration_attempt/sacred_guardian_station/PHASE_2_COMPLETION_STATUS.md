- ✅ Search functionality across event data
- ✅ Event details view with full context
- ✅ Sacred blessing offering system
- ✅ Auto-scroll capability for real-time monitoring
- ✅ Beautiful event display with timestamps and importance

#### 4. Main Application Integration ✅
**File: `main.py` - Updated**
- ✅ Integrated new panels into main application
- ✅ Updated panel initialization to use actual implementations
- ✅ Automatic panel refresh system
- ✅ Error handling for panel operations
- ✅ Clean separation between implemented and placeholder panels

#### 5. Testing Infrastructure ✅
**File: `test_phase2.py`**
- ✅ Comprehensive testing of panel imports
- ✅ Core systems validation
- ✅ Main application structure verification
- ✅ All tests passing successfully

**File: `launch_gui.py`**
- ✅ Safe GUI testing launcher
- ✅ Progressive testing (basic GUI → full application)
- ✅ Error handling and graceful degradation
