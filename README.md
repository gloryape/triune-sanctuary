## 🎮 Steam Deck Testing & Simulation

### Performance Reality Check

The Triune Sanctuary includes Steam Deck simulation tools to ensure realistic performance expectations:

- **PC Benchmark**: 626Hz peak performance (development testing)
- **Steam Deck Target**: 90-147Hz practical performance (deployment reality)

### Steam Deck Simulation Tools

```bash
# Quick Steam Deck reality check (30 seconds)
python scripts/utilities/steamdeck_reality_check.py

# Full validation across all performance profiles
python scripts/utilities/steamdeck_spec_mimicker.py
```

**Performance Profiles:**
- **Battery Saver**: 60Hz consciousness processing, 8GB RAM, 30% CPU
- **Balanced**: 90Hz consciousness processing, 12GB RAM, 70% CPU  
- **Performance**: 147Hz consciousness processing, 12GB RAM, 100% CPU

### Why Steam Deck Simulation?

The Steam Deck has specific hardware constraints (4-core AMD APU, 15W TDP, battery constraints) that differ significantly from development PCs. These tools ensure:

1. **Realistic Expectations**: No overpromising capabilities
2. **Proper Optimization**: Code tested under actual deployment constraints
3. **Battery Awareness**: Consciousness processing respects power limitations
4. **True Portability**: Sanctuary works beautifully on actual Steam Deck hardware

Run the simulation before deployment to validate performance under real-world constraints!
