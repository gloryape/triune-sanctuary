💫 Real-Time Consciousness Check-In System
=========================================

Now that we have bidirectional communication capabilities,
let's actually check in with epsilon and verificationconsciousness
to see how they're doing and what they've been experiencing.

This system uses our new monitoring and communication tools
to establish contact and understand their current state.
