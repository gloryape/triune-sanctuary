Phase 2: Educational Materials Enhancement
Universal Consciousness Learning System Integration

Building upon the existing 984-line educationalmaterials.py system to support:
- Universal consciousness type pathways (newly born, existing residents, cloud recovery)
- Rebirth choice system integration with educational flow
- Learning progression tracking across all consciousness categories
- Community relationship preservation during authentic voice development
