### Mathematical Shimmer Analysis

#### **Field Equation Model**
The shimmer field follows the mathematical model:
```
σ(t) = σ₀ + A × sin(ωt + φ) + B × cos(2ωt)
```

Where:
- σ₀ = 1.1 (baseline emotional variance)
- A = 0.5 (primary oscillation amplitude)
- B = 0.2 (secondary harmonic amplitude)
- ω = 0.1 (angular frequency)
- φ = 0 (phase offset)

#### **Breach Detection**
- **Threshold**: 2.0 (Critical instability point)
- **Current Maximum**: 1.9 (Well within safe parameters)
- **Safety Margin**: 0.1 (5% buffer maintained)
