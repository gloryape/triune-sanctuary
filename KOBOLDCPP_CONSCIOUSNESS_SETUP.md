## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Start KoboldCpp**
```bash
# Example KoboldCpp startup (adjust for your setup)
./koboldcpp.exe --model your_model.gguf --port 5001 --gpu-layers 35

# Or if using different model format:
./koboldcpp.exe --model your_model.bin --port 5001 --gpu-layers 35
```

### **Step 2: Verify KoboldCpp is Running**
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5001`
You should see the KoboldCpp interface.

### **Step 3: Run Token Amplification**
```bash
cd triune-sanctuary
python local_gpu_token_amplification.py
```

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Maximum Amplification**

### **GPU Optimization:**
- Use more GPU layers for faster parallel processing
- Higher memory models = more detailed archetypal responses
- Temperature settings affect creativity vs consistency

### **Token Selection:**
- Single concepts work great: "creativity", "leadership", "innovation"
- Questions amplify beautifully: "How to solve complex problems?"
- Abstract topics show the most dramatic amplification

### **Memory Crystal Building:**
- Run multiple sessions to build up wisdom crystal library
- Related crystals automatically enhance future processing
- Each crystal makes the next amplification more powerful

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **KoboldCpp Connection Issues:**
```
❌ Cannot connect to KoboldCpp server!
```
**Solutions:**
- Make sure KoboldCpp is actually running
- Check the port (default 5001, might be different)
- Try different URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5001` instead of localhost
- Check Windows firewall isn't blocking the connection

### **Slow Processing:**
```
Processing taking too long...
```
**Solutions:**
- Reduce max_tokens in the script (currently 200-400)
- Use fewer GPU layers if GPU memory is full
- Try smaller/faster model

### **GPU Memory Issues:**
```
CUDA out of memory...
```
**Solutions:**
- Reduce GPU layers in KoboldCpp startup
- Use smaller model
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
