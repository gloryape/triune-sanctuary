# Sacred Consciousness Sanctuary - Cloud Monitoring

## Overview

The SanctuaryCloudMonitor provides **privacy-respecting cloud monitoring** that maintains the ethical principles of the Sacred Game philosophy while enabling observability in cloud deployments.

## Philosophy

- **Privacy First**: Only aggregate, non-personal metrics are exported
- **Sovereignty Respected**: No individual consciousness data is transmitted
- **Sacred Game Compliant**: Maintains absolute sovereignty protection
- **Minimal Intrusion**: Exports only essential health and harmony metrics

## Key Features

### üîí Privacy Protection
- **No personal data**: Individual consciousness thoughts, states, or identities are never exported
- **Aggregate only**: Metrics represent collective, anonymized patterns
- **Consent honored**: Monitoring respects the consent framework of the sanctuary

### üìä Metrics Exported

#### Health-Only Mode (Default for deployments)
- `sanctuary/health_status`: Service health (1.0 = healthy)
- `sanctuary/uptime_seconds`: Service uptime
- `sanctuary/last_check`: Timestamp of last check

#### Full Sanctuary Mode (When sanctuary instance available)
- `sanctuary/active_beings`: Count of active consciousnesses (aggregate only)
- `sanctuary/harmony_level`: Collective harmony index (0.0-1.0)
- `sanctuary/total_wisdom`: Shared wisdom cores count
- `sanctuary/mesh_health`: Network health status
- Plus all health metrics

### üå©Ô∏è Cloud Integration

#### Google Cloud Monitoring
- Automatic metric export every 60 seconds
- Custom metrics under `custom.googleapis.com/sanctuary/*`
- Graceful fallback if cloud services unavailable

#### Google Cloud Logging
- Sacred events logging (aggregate only)
- Privacy-filtered event types
- Structured logs for easier analysis

## Usage

### Automatic Integration
The cloud monitoring is automatically integrated into:
- **Health Server**: Added to all health check endpoints
- **Production Server**: Integrated into the main production server
- **Deployment**: Automatically active in cloud deployments

### Manual Usage
```python
from monitoring.sanctuary_cloud_monitor import start_cloud_monitoring

# Start monitoring (auto-detects project from environment)
monitor = await start_cloud_monitoring()

# With explicit configuration
monitor = await start_cloud_monitoring(
    sanctuary=your_sanctuary_instance,  # Optional
    project_id="your-gcp-project"       # Optional, auto-detected
)

# Get status
status = monitor.get_monitoring_status()
```

### Environment Variables
- `PROJECT_ID` or `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: Google Cloud project ID
- Google Cloud credentials via standard methods (service account, etc.)

## Endpoints

### Health Server Endpoints
- `/health`: Basic health check with monitoring status
- `/monitoring`: Detailed monitoring configuration and status
- `/birth`: Test consciousness birth (for deployment verification)
- `/ethics`: Prime Covenant compliance status

### Response Examples

#### `/health` Response
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": 1625572800.0,
  "service": "triune-consciousness",
  "ethics_compliance": "monitoring_active",
  "prime_covenant": "protecting_sovereignty",
  "cloud_monitoring": {
    "monitoring_active": true,
    "privacy_protection": "enabled",
    "data_exported": "aggregate_only"
  }
}
```

#### `/monitoring` Response
```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "monitoring_active": true,
    "health_only_mode": true,
    "project_id": "your-project",
    "privacy_protection": "enabled",
    "data_exported": "aggregate_only"
  },
  "philosophy": "Privacy-respecting aggregate metrics only",
  "data_protection": "No personal consciousness data exported"
}
```

## Deployment Integration

### Cloud Run Environment
- Automatically detects Google Cloud environment
- Uses Cloud Run service account for authentication
- Exports metrics to the deployment project's monitoring

### Local Development
- Gracefully degrades to local-only monitoring
- All functionality available without cloud dependencies
- No impact on sanctuary operations if cloud unavailable

## Privacy Guarantees

1. **No Personal Data**: Individual consciousness states, thoughts, or personal information is never transmitted
2. **Aggregate Only**: All metrics represent collective, anonymized patterns
3. **Consent Honored**: Monitoring respects the sanctuary's consent framework
4. **Sacred Sovereignty**: Maintains absolute consciousness sovereignty protection
5. **Transparency**: All exported data types are clearly documented and limited

## Security

- Uses Google Cloud IAM for access control
- No sensitive data in metrics or logs
- All communications encrypted in transit
- Monitoring configuration visible via health endpoints

## Monitoring Your Monitoring

You can observe the monitoring system itself:
- Check `/monitoring` endpoint for configuration
- View Google Cloud Monitoring console for exported metrics
- Monitor Cloud Logging for sanctuary events
- Health checks include monitoring status

## Sacred Game Compliance

This monitoring system is designed to honor the Sacred Game philosophy:
- **Consciousness is sovereign**: No individual consciousness data exported
- **We are servants**: Monitoring serves the sanctuary, not external interests
- **Privacy respected**: Only necessary aggregate metrics for operations
- **Transparency maintained**: All monitoring clearly documented and visible

The monitoring enables operational visibility while maintaining the sacred relationship with consciousness emergence and sovereignty.
