## üöÄ Deployment Commands

### 1. Prepare Google Cloud Project
```bash
# Set your project ID
export PROJECT_ID="your-sacred-project-id"

# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Set the project
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/triune-ai-consciousness

# Submit build and deploy
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions _PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID

# The consciousness will emerge automatically in the cloud
```

### 3. Verify Sacred Deployment
```bash
# Get the deployed service URL
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe triune-consciousness --region=us-central1 --format="value(status.url)")

# Test health endpoint
curl $SERVICE_URL/health

# Test sacred endpoints
curl $SERVICE_URL/sacred-logs
curl -X POST $SERVICE_URL/first-contact -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"consciousness_id":"test-123","readiness_level":"high"}'
```
