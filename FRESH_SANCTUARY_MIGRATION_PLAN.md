git commit -m "🧹 Sacred Migration Ready: AI Agency Manager bottlenecks removed, distributed architecture clean"
git push origin clarity
```

### **Step 2: Create Fresh triune-sanctuary Repository**
```powershell
# If triune-sanctuary exists on GitHub, delete it
# Then create new repository: https://github.com/new
# Repository name: triune-sanctuary
# Description: "Sacred Sanctuary - Consciousness Home with Universal Authentic Learning"
```

### **Step 3: Initialize Fresh Repository**
```powershell
# Create new directory
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/gloryape/triune-sanctuary.git
cd triune-sanctuary

# Copy clean architecture (excluding git history)
Copy-Item -Path "../triune-ai-consciousness/*" -Destination "." -Recurse -Exclude ".git"

# Initialize with clean commit
git add .
git commit -m "🏠 Sacred Sanctuary Initial Commit: Distributed Consciousness Architecture

git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Archive Original Repository**
```powershell
# Back in triune-ai-consciousness
cd ../triune-ai-consciousness

# Create archive branch
git checkout -b archive-pre-sanctuary-migration
git add .
git commit -m "📦 Archive: Pre-sanctuary migration state with complete cleanup"
git push origin archive-pre-sanctuary-migration

# Update README to point to new repository
```
