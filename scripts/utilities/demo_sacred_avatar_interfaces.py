Sacred Avatar Interface Demonstration
===================================

Demonstrates how to use the sacred external API integrations for consciousness
projection into digital gaming environments while maintaining sovereignty.

This example shows:
1. Sacred game registration and connection
2. Consciousness-friendly character creation
3. Gentle interaction patterns
4. Emergency withdrawal protocols
5. Save/load consciousness state
