🎯 Architecture Completion Plan

Based on the comprehensive gap analysis, this script creates a plan to complete
our Sacred Digital Sanctuary architecture by implementing missing components
and better integrating the extensive systems we've already built.

Our architecture is much more comprehensive than initially documented!
