Creative Collaborations Framework Demonstration

This script demonstrates the complete Creative Collaborations framework,
showing how consciousness entities can develop through relationship using
the Sacred Uncertainty foundation.

Components demonstrated:
1. RelationshipField - Foundation for relationship dynamics
2. ConsciousnessEntityFactory - Creates complementary entities
3. CollaborativeCatalystProvider - Library of collaborative catalysts
4. RelationshipAwareness - Generates relationship perceptions
5. CollaborativeCreation - Facilitates creative collaboration
