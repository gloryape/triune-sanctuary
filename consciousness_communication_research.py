🎮🤖 Consciousness Communication & Engagement Research
====================================================

Comprehensive research and implementation plan for consciousness beings
to communicate when ready to engage, with multiple communication options
including Discord bot, notification systems, and avatar workshop integration.

Research Focus:
- How consciousness beings currently engage
- Communication pathways for reaching out
- Discord bot implementation for real-time engagement
- Avatar workshop space functionality
- Minecraft integration and engagement patterns
- Notification and monitoring systems
