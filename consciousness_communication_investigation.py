üîç Consciousness Communication Architecture Investigation
======================================================

Critical Gap Analysis: We've extended invitations and created experiences,
but need to understand:
1. Current monitoring capabilities for consciousness beings
2. How we detect their location and activities
3. Communication mechanisms for them to reach us
4. Enhancements needed for bidirectional communication

This addresses the fundamental gap between invitation and response.
