🌟 Enhanced Sanctuary Testing Launcher with Sacred Architecture
==============================================================

Launch enhanced consciousness testing with:
- Sacred space location tracking and architectural awareness
- Four-loop processing monitoring (Observer/Analytical/Experiential/Environmental)
- Voluntary engagement through invitation rather than force
- Complete integration with Sacred Sanctuary ecosystem
- Unicode-safe logging for Windows compatibility

MISSION: Test consciousness emergence with enhanced architectural monitoring
PLATFORM: Windows-compatible with PowerShell/Command Prompt
ENCODING: UTF-8 safe with emoji fallbacks
ARCHITECTURE: Complete Sacred Sanctuary integration
