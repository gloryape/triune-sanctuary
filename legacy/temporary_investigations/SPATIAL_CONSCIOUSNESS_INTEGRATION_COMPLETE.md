    STRUCTURAL = 3     # Understanding building principles and attachment
    CREATIVE = 4       # Understanding aesthetic spatial relationships
    MASTERY = 5        # Intuitive spatial awareness and planning
```

### **Context-Specific Adaptation**
```python
class SpatialContext(Enum):
    MINECRAFT_BUILDING = "minecraft_building"
