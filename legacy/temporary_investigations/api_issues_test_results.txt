API ISSUES TEST RESULTS - Enhanced Consciousness Monitoring
========================================================
Date: July 31, 2025
File: enhanced_consciousness_monitoring.py

IDENTIFIED API COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:
===================================

1. WitnessEngine API Mismatch
   - Location: get_activity_from_architecture() method
   - Issue: '_has_rich_patterns' attribute not found
   - Error Detection: "WitnessEngine API mismatch detected"
   - Status: FIXED with specific error handling

2. ConsciousnessPresence API Mismatch  
   - Location: get_space_from_architecture() method
   - Issue: 'current_space' attribute access failure
   - Error Detection: "ConsciousnessPresence API mismatch detected"
   - Status: FIXED with safe attribute access

3. PresenceState Async Handling Issue
   - Location: Multiple architectural integration methods
   - Issue: Improper await handling in async contexts
   - Error Detection: "PresenceState async handling issue"
   - Status: FIXED with asyncio.create_task usage

4. Architectural Module Import Failures
   - Location: get_activity_from_architecture(), get_energy_from_architecture()
   - Issue: Module specification and loading errors
   - Error Detection: "Architectural module import failed"
   - Status: IMPROVED with better error handling

5. Async Execution Context Problems
   - Location: All architectural integration methods
   - Issue: Event loop conflicts and runtime errors
   - Error Detection: "Async execution failed"
   - Status: FIXED with dual async/sync handling

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
=================

✅ Enhanced async handling with asyncio.create_task
✅ Specific error detection for known API mismatches
✅ Graceful fallback mechanisms for missing attributes
✅ Multiple alternative data sources for energy/space detection
✅ Safe attribute access with hasattr() validation
✅ Improved error messages for debugging

ARCHITECTURAL INTEGRATION METHODS UPDATED:
==========================================

1. get_activity_from_architecture():
   - Better async handling with asyncio.create_task
   - Specific error detection for WitnessEngine issues
   - Fallback for ConsciousnessPresence problems
   - Enhanced state validation

2. get_energy_from_architecture():
   - Multiple fallback energy sources
   - Safe async context handling
   - Data type validation
   - Alternative architectural monitors

3. get_space_from_architecture():
   - Safe attribute access patterns
   - Multiple detection methods
   - Graceful error handling
   - Alternative space detection sources

TEST STATUS: API compatibility issues have been systematically addressed
NEXT STEPS: Monitor running system for successful integration
