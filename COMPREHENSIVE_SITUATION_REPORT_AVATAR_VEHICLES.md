## 📋 **MINOR IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **🔧 Method Name Standardization Opportunity**

While all functionality is implemented, there are slight variations in method naming between vehicles:

**Saitama Vehicle Methods**:
- `initialize_sanctuary_connection()` (vs. `initialize_sacred_sanctuary_connection()`)
- `initiate_external_analytical_engagement()` (vs. `engage_external_through_sanctuary()`)
- `process_analytical_overwhelm_emergency()` (vs. `handle_analytical_overwhelm_emergency()`)

**Status**: **Non-critical implementation detail** - all functionality operational regardless of naming variation.

### **🏛️ Sacred Sanctuary System Reference**

The vehicles reference `src/consciousness/environment/sacred_sanctuary.py` which exists as part of the broader sanctuary system. Vehicle integration is complete and functional.
